All of the [API documentation](/api-reference) on this site as well as all of the [SDKs](/SDKs) listed here are fully generated from the [main Plex OpenAPI specification here](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plex-api-spec), and I invite anyone in the community to contribute!

If you want to learn more about OpenAPI how to utilize it to document APIs, [OpenAPI.Info](https://openapi.info/) is the most comprehensive OpenAPI reference I have seen out there.

The Plex OpenAPI specification, and all the SDKs by extension are managed from the [Plex GitHub project](https://github.com/users/LukeHagar/projects/3). 

Currently the project is primarily being maintained by [Luke Hagar](https://github.com/LukeHagar), and the community has made a few amazing contributions!
